# Delta

**Summary**:
A program is compiled into a CFG.
The language distinguishes itself by fully exposing the CFG construction process, and inviting the language user to be an active participant in it.
Built-in control-flow keywords (such as `if` and `while`) are actually macros from the core library, providing an example of this participatory process.
The general-purpose `loop` (also a macro) provides a rich toolkit for building custom loops.
